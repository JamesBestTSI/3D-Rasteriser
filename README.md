# 3D-Rasteriser Project
The objective of this was to build from scratch an application that could take in a 3D model in the form of a .MD2 file, and then display it on screen using my own draw functions and lighting functions.

## The project is able to do the following:
* Drawing Lines
* 2D Vertex Class
* Matrix Class
* - Get/Set
* - Matrix*Matrix
* - Matrix*Vertex
* - Matrix=Matrix
* Transform Matrix
* Scale Matrix
* Rotation Matrix
* Polygon3D Class
* Model Class
* Camera Class
* Perspective Matrix
* View Matrix
* Draw Model Wireframe
* Backface Culling
* - Vector Normals
* - Vector dot products
* Depth Sorting
* Draw Solid Model
* Ambient Light
* Directional light
* Point light
* Custom Draw polygon
